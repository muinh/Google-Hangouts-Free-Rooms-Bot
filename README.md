# Google-Hangouts-Free-Rooms-Bot
Google Hangouts Bot developed specially for wikr.com.

For proper use you'll need three files.
- First one you'll find in the repo.(main.py)
- Second one is a credentials.json file. You need to generate and get it from Google Hangouts Admin Panel.
- The third one is a token.pickle file. Don't worry if you don't have it in your repository. Just start the app for the first time and it will be generated automatically.

To start the app, run the main.py
